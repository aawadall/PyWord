# WWP
Web based Word Processor

## About
In this repository, I will capture my thought processes on how to create an online (Web Based) Word Processor.

I should start by listing features, that will creep into a backlog, following Agile methodology. 

## Plan
I will try to:
* [ ] Define the _Minimum Viable Product_ (MVP) to launch an _Alpha_ release 
* [ ] Build required infrastructure to deploy sample instance 
* [ ] Follow _Test Driven Development_ approach to start clean 

## Early thoughts
* I might use Python, mixed with HTML, CSS, and Mongodb 
* Use of Python might imply  using a standard Python supporting Web framework. Most probably Django 
* I was pondering the idea of using containers
